## Welcome to Box-Full of Hospitality!

Recognizing the lives we were given as fortunate ones, we strive to do the same and give back to the children in the Philippines, especially to those who are limited in supplies and sources for the proper education. By organizing and selling self-care packages to buyers and those that wish to uplift and improve the lives of these children, we hope to raise funds  in a way that gives joy to everyone. 

### How to support our non-profit organization

Disclaimer: All the supplies that we sell in each and every self-care package to buyers are not items made by our organization, but are items bought and resold for the retail price we provide. We are not responsible for any allergic reactions or items tat are broken. Read Terms and Services and Terms of Conditions before buying.

Currently, since we are only starting out, we are limited to selling self-care packages, but will increase our variety and options in the future. When buying a self-care package, you receive items such as:
1. a beauty face mask
2. a bath bomb
3. a scented candle
4. a pair of fuzzy socks
5. a face mask and scrunchie (set)
6. a lip gloss 
7. 2 vsco stickers
