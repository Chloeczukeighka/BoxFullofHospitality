## Learn about the the "Forgotten Asian Americans"!

Did you know that Filipino Americans were the first asian-prgin to have arrived in north america? The Ailipino AMerican community is the second-largest asian american group in the united states and make up around 20% of the total Asian American population. In spite of this, in the 1,126 New York Times articles archived under the subject "Asian American", only 6% mentioned filipinos, although the statistic suggest that filipinos would be feautured regularly in news stories about asian americans. Even among newspapers in California, where Filipinos constitue the largest Asian American group, the pattern is the same. 

### But... Why?

The media marginalizes Filipinos because they don't fit their prescribed definition of Asian American Identity and unlike other asians, US-born FIlipinos are overwhelmingly monolingual english speaker. To the media, Filipinos are "too American" to fit rhe "Quintessential" Asian American experience. Also, Filipinos are omitted from Asian American stories because their cultural experiences align more with Latinos.
